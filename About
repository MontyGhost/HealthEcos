A real time health monitoring system for the people especially elderly ones.
The prototype is developed to provide an ecosystem for health monitoring
including the medication management to continuous monitoring of vitals like
pulse and temperature and fall detection. Notifications are immediately sent
to alert the user and the patient if any incident happens.
The prototype is realized using esp8266 based Wi-Fi module NodeMCU (12e),
DSP310 pressure sensor, pulse sensor, servo motor and Amazon echo dot.
Blynk app is used for sending the notifications and monitoring the data from
band and pill dispenser.
Alexa skills Kit is used for developing the custom alexa skill for the dispenser
and AWS Lambda is used in backend for the processing of data from skills
services and coneecting it to Blynk server, enabling the control of dispenser
from Alexa device.

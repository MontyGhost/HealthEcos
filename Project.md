A real time health monitoring system for the people especially elderly ones.
The prototype is developed to provide an ecosystem for health monitoring
including the medication management to continuous monitoring of vitals like
pulse and temperature and fall detection.

Objectives

● Temperature Measurement: The band is in contact with the arm and gives the live temperature of the Patients. Any spikes or drops will be notified to caregivers. 

● Fall Detection: Monitoring of motion of the person, such as sudden fall due to heart attacks or losing balance, or abnormal fall. Sends notification when a person is unable to get up in a specified time. 

● Pulse Rate Measurement: Continuous monitoring of pulse rate, sends notification to caregiver if abnormal fall or rise in pulse rate is detected.

● Automatic pill dispenser: Automatic dispenser will help those who have medications and vitamins that they need to take on a daily basis. It can be quite difficult to remember what pills to take when and how much the correct dosage is.

● Notification to user and caregiver: If the pills are missed or any emergency situation arises caregiver will be notified immediately.

● Amazon Alexa Skills Script: Build a voice user interface, which makes the product user friendly and more reliable.

● Interface with Blynk App: All the data collected with the help of sensors would be sent to Blynk App. The App will also help the guardian/caretaker/relative of the Patients to monitor the health of the Patients remotely.
